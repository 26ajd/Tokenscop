Run your Flutter app on an attached device.

Global options:
-h, --help                      Print this usage information.
-v, --verbose                   Noisy logging, including all shell commands executed.
                                If used with "--help", shows hidden options. If used with "flutter doctor", shows additional diagnostic information. (Use "-vv" to force verbose logging in those cases.)
    --prefixed-errors           Causes lines sent to stderr to be prefixed with "ERROR:".
    --quiet                     Reduce the amount of output from some commands.
    --[no-]wrap                 Toggles output word wrapping, regardless of whether or not the output is a terminal.
                                (defaults to on)
    --wrap-column               Sets the output wrap column. If not set, uses the width of the terminal. No wrapping occurs if not writing to a terminal. Use "--no-wrap" to turn off wrapping when connected to a terminal.
-d, --device-id                 Target device id or name (prefixes allowed).
    --version                   Reports the version of this tool.
    --machine                   When used with the "--version" flag, outputs the information using JSON.
    --[no-]color                Whether to use terminal colors (requires support for ANSI escape sequences).
                                (defaults to on)
    --[no-]version-check        Allow Flutter to check for updates when this command runs.
                                (defaults to on)
    --enable-analytics          Enable telemetry reporting each time a flutter or dart command runs.
    --disable-analytics         Disable telemetry reporting each time a flutter or dart command runs, until it is re-enabled.
    --suppress-analytics        Suppress analytics reporting for the current CLI invocation.
    --packages                  Path to your "package_config.json" file.
    --print-dtd                 Print the address of the Dart Tooling Daemon, if one is hosted by the Flutter CLI.

Local build selection options (not normally required):
    --local-engine-src-path     Path to your engine src directory, if you are building Flutter locally.
                                Defaults to $FLUTTER_ENGINE if set, otherwise defaults to the path given in your pubspec.yaml dependency_overrides for sky_engine, if any.
    --local-engine              Name of a build output within the engine out directory, if you are building Flutter locally.
                                Use this to select a specific version of the engine if you have built multiple engine targets.
                                This path is relative to "--local-engine-src-path" (see above).
    --local-engine-host         The host operating system for which engine artifacts should be selected, if you are building Flutter locally.
                                This is only used when "--local-engine" is also specified.
                                By default, the host is determined automatically, but you may need to specify this if you are building on one platform (e.g. MacOS ARM64) but intend to run Flutter on another (e.g. Android).
    --local-web-sdk             Name of a build output within the engine out directory, if you are building Flutter locally.
                                Use this to select a specific version of the web sdk if you have built multiple engine targets.
                                This path is relative to "--local-engine-src-path" (see above).

Options for testing the "flutter" tool itself:
    --show-test-device          List the special "flutter-tester" device in device listings. This headless device is used to test Flutter tooling.
    --show-web-server-device    List the special "web-server" device in device listings.
    --ci                        Enable a set of CI-specific test debug settings.
    --debug-logs-dir            Path to a directory where logs for debugging may be added.

Usage: flutter run [arguments]
-h, --help                                                   Print this usage information.
    --debug                                                  Build a debug version of your app (default mode).
    --profile                                                Build a version of your app specialized for performance profiling.
    --release                                                Build a release version of your app.
    --jit-release                                            Build a JIT release version of your app.
-D, --dart-define=<foo=bar>                                  Additional key-value pairs that will be available as constants from the String.fromEnvironment, bool.fromEnvironment, and int.fromEnvironment constructors.
                                                             Multiple defines can be passed by repeating "--dart-define" multiple times.
    --dart-define-from-file=<use-define-config.json|.env>    The path of a .json or .env file containing key-value pairs that will be available as environment variables.
                                                             These can be accessed using the String.fromEnvironment, bool.fromEnvironment, and int.fromEnvironment constructors.
                                                             Multiple defines can be passed by repeating "--dart-define-from-file" multiple times.
                                                             Entries from "--dart-define" with identical keys take precedence over entries from these files.
    --flavor                                                 Build a custom app flavor as defined by platform-specific build setup.
                                                             Supports the use of product flavors in Android Gradle scripts, and the use of custom Xcode schemes.
                                                             Overrides the value of the "default-flavor" entry in the flutter pubspec.
    --[no-]web-resources-cdn                                 Use Web static resources hosted on a CDN.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --[no-]native-null-assertions                            Enables additional runtime null checks in web applications to ensure the correct nullability of native (such as in dart:html) and external (such as with JS interop) types. This is enabled by default but only takes effect in sound mode. To report an issue with a null assertion failure in dart:html or the other dart web libraries, please file a bug at: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/labels/web-libraries
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --use-application-binary=<path/to/app.apk>               Specify a pre-built application binary to use when running. For Android applications, this must be the path to an APK. For iOS applications, the path to an IPA. Other device types do not yet support prebuilt application binaries.
    --trace-startup                                          Trace application startup, then exit, saving the trace to a file. By default, this will be saved in the "build" directory. If the FLUTTER_TEST_OUTPUTS_DIR environment variable is set, the file will be written there instead.
    --[no-]cache-startup-profile                             Caches the CPU profile collected before the first frame for startup analysis.
    --verbose-system-logs                                    Include verbose logging from the Flutter engine.
    --purge-persistent-cache                                 Removes all existing persistent caches. This allows reproducing shader compilation jank that normally only happens the first time an app is run, or for reliable testing of compilation jank fixes (e.g. shader warm-up).
    --route                                                  Which route to load when running the app.
    --vmservice-out-file=<project/example/out.txt>           A file to write the attached vmservice URL to after an application is started.
    --disable-service-auth-codes                             (deprecated) Allow connections to the VM service without using authentication codes. (Not recommended! This can open your device to remote code execution attacks!)
    --[no-]start-paused                                      Start in a paused mode and wait for a debugger to connect.
    --dart-flags                                             Pass a list of comma separated flags to the Dart instance at application startup. Flags passed through this option must be present on the allowlist defined within the Flutter engine. If a disallowed flag is encountered, the process will be terminated immediately.

                                                             This flag is not available on the stable channel and is only applied in debug and profile modes. This option should only be used for experiments and should not be used by typical users.
    --endless-trace-buffer                                   Enable tracing to an infinite buffer, instead of a ring buffer. This is useful when recording large traces. To use an endless buffer to record startup traces, combine this with "--trace-startup".
    --trace-systrace                                         Enable tracing to the system tracer. This is only useful on platforms where such a tracer is available (Android, iOS, macOS and Fuchsia).
    --trace-to-file=<path/to/trace.binpb>                    Write the timeline trace to a file at the specified path. The file will be in Perfetto's proto format; it will be possible to load the file into Perfetto's trace viewer.
    --profile-microtasks                                     Enable collection of information about each microtask. Information about completed microtasks will be written to the "Microtask" timeline stream. Information about queued microtasks will be accessible from Dart / Flutter DevTools.
    --trace-skia                                             Enable tracing of Skia code. This is useful when debugging the raster thread (formerly known as the GPU thread). By default, Flutter will not log Skia code, as it introduces significant overhead that may affect recorded performance metrics in a misleading way.
    --trace-allowlist=<foo,bar>                              Filters out all trace events except those that are specified in this comma separated list of allowed prefixes.
    --trace-skia-allowlist=<skia.gpu,skia.shaders>           Filters out all Skia trace events except those that are specified in this comma separated list of allowed prefixes.
    --[no-]enable-dart-profiling                             Whether the Dart VM sampling CPU profiler is enabled. This flag is only meaningful in debug and profile builds.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --profile-startup                                        Make the profiler discard new samples once the profiler sample buffer is full. When this flag is not set, the profiler sample buffer is used as a ring buffer, meaning that once it is full, new samples start overwriting the oldest ones.
    --enable-software-rendering                              (deprecated) Enable rendering using the Skia software backend. This is useful when testing Flutter on emulators. By default, Flutter will attempt to either use OpenGL or Vulkan and fall back to software when neither is available. This option is not supported when using the Impeller rendering engine.
    --skia-deterministic-rendering                           (deprecated) When combined with "--enable-software-rendering", this should provide completely deterministic (i.e. reproducible) Skia rendering. This is useful for testing purposes (e.g. when comparing screenshots). This option is not supported when using the Impeller rendering engine.
-a, --dart-entrypoint-args                                   Pass a list of arguments to the Dart entrypoint at application startup. By default this is main(List<String> args). Specify this option multiple times each with one argument to pass multiple arguments to the Dart entrypoint. Currently this is only supported on desktop platforms.
    --[no-]uninstall-first                                   Uninstall previous versions of the app on the device before reinstalling. Currently only supported on iOS.
    --wasm                                                   Compile to WebAssembly rather than JavaScript.
                                                             See https://flutter.dev/to/wasm for more information.
    --web-header=<X-Custom-Header=header-value>              Additional key-value pairs that will added by the web server as headers to all responses. Multiple headers can be passed by repeating "--web-header" multiple times.
    --web-hostname                                           The hostname that the web server will use to resolve an IP to serve from. The unresolved hostname is used to launch Chrome when using the chrome Device. The name "any" may also be used to serve on any IPV4 for either the Chrome or web-server device.
    --web-port                                               The host port to serve the web application from. If not provided, the tool will select a random open port on the host.
    --web-tls-cert-path                                      The certificate that host will use to serve using TLS connection. If not provided, the tool will use default http scheme.
    --web-tls-cert-key-path                                  The certificate key that host will use to authenticate cert. If not provided, the tool will use default http scheme.
    --web-server-debug-protocol                              The protocol (SSE or WebSockets) to use for the debug service proxy when using the Web Server device and Dart Debug extension. This is useful for editors/debug adapters that do not support debugging over SSE (the default protocol for Web Server/Dart Debugger extension).
                                                             [sse, ws (default)]
    --web-server-debug-backend-protocol                      The protocol (SSE or WebSockets) to use for the Dart Debug Extension backend service when using the Web Server device. Using WebSockets can improve performance but may fail when connecting through some proxy servers.
                                                             [sse, ws (default)]
    --web-server-debug-injected-client-protocol              The protocol (SSE or WebSockets) to use for the injected client when using the Web Server device. Using WebSockets can improve performance but may fail when connecting through some proxy servers.
                                                             [sse, ws (default)]
    --[no-]web-allow-expose-url                              Enables daemon-to-editor requests (app.exposeUrl) for exposing URLs when running on remote machines.
    --[no-]web-run-headless                                  Launches the browser in headless mode. Currently only Chrome supports this option.
    --web-browser-debug-port                                 The debug port the browser should use. If not specified, a random port is selected. Currently only Chrome supports this option. It serves the Chrome DevTools Protocol (https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).
    --[no-]web-enable-expression-evaluation                  Enables expression evaluation in the debugger.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --[no-]web-experimental-hot-reload                       Enables new module format that supports hot reload.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --web-launch-url                                         The URL to provide to the browser. Defaults to an HTTP URL with the host name of "--web-hostname", the port of "--web-port", and the path set to "/".
    --web-browser-flag=<--foo=bar>                           Additional flag to pass to a browser instance at startup.
                                                             Chrome: https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags/
                                                             Firefox: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/CommandLineOptions
                                                             Multiple flags can be passed by repeating "--web-browser-flag" multiple times.
-t, --target=<path>                                          The main entry-point file of the application, as run on the device.
                                                             If the "--target" option is omitted, but a file name is provided on the command line, then that is used instead.
                                                             (defaults to "lib\main.dart")
    --vm-service-port                                        (deprecated; use host-vmservice-port instead) Listen to the given port for a Dart VM Service connection.
                                                             Specifying port 0 (the default) will find a random free port.
                                                              if the Dart Development Service (DDS) is enabled, this will not be the port of the VmService instance advertised on the command line.
    --device-vmservice-port                                  Look for vmservice connections only from the specified port.
                                                             Specifying port 0 (the default) will accept the first vmservice discovered.
    --host-vmservice-port                                    When a device-side vmservice port is forwarded to a host-side port, use this value as the host port.
                                                             Specifying port 0 (the default) will find a random free host port.
    --ipv6                                                   Binds to IPv6 localhost instead of IPv4 when the flutter tool forwards the host port to a device port.
    --[no-]pub                                               Whether to run "flutter pub get" before executing this command.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --[no-]track-widget-creation                             Track widget creation locations. This enables features such as the widget inspector. This parameter is only functional in debug mode (i.e. when compiling JIT, not AOT).
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --device-user=<10>                                       Identifier number for a user or work profile on Android only. Run "adb shell pm list users" for available identifiers.
    --device-timeout=<10>                                    Time in seconds to wait for devices to attach. Longer timeouts may be necessary for networked devices.
    --device-connection                                      Discover devices based on connection type.

          [both] (default)                                   Searches for both attached and wireless devices.
          [attached]                                         Only searches for devices connected by USB or built-in (such as simulators/emulators, MacOS/Windows, Chrome)
          [wireless]                                         Only searches for devices connected wirelessly. Discovering wireless devices may take longer.

    --dds-port                                               When this value is provided, the Dart Development Service (DDS) will be bound to the provided port.
                                                             Specifying port 0 (the default) will find a random free port.
    --[no-]dds                                               Enable the Dart Developer Service (DDS).
                                                             It may be necessary to disable this when attaching to an application with an existing DDS instance (e.g., attaching to an application currently connected to by "flutter run"), or when running certain tests.
                                                             Disabling this feature may degrade IDE functionality if a DDS instance is not already connected to the target application.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --[no-]disable-dds                                       (deprecated; use "--no-dds" instead) Disable the Dart Developer Service (DDS).
    --[no-]devtools                                          Enable (or disable, with "--no-devtools") the launching of the Flutter DevTools debugger and profiler. If "--no-devtools" is specified, "--devtools-server-address" is ignored.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --devtools-server-address                                When this value is provided, the Flutter tool will not spin up a new DevTools server instance, and will instead use the one provided at the given address. Ignored if "--no-devtools" is specified.
    --[no-]android-gradle-daemon                             Whether to enable the Gradle daemon when performing an Android build. Starting the daemon is the default behavior of the gradle wrapper script created in a Flutter project. Setting this flag to false corresponds to passing "--no-daemon" to the gradle wrapper script. This flag will cause the daemon process to terminate after the build is completed.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --[no-]android-skip-build-dependency-validation          Whether to skip version checking for Java, Gradle, the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP), and the Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) during Android builds.
-P, --android-project-arg                                    Additional arguments specified as key=value that are passed directly to the gradle project via the -P flag. These can be accessed in build.gradle via the "project.property" API.
    --android-project-cache-dir                              Specifies the project-specific cache directory. Defaults to .gradle.
    --[no-]fatal-warnings                                    Causes the command to fail if warnings are sent to the console during its execution.
    --[no-]enable-impeller                                   Whether to enable the Impeller rendering engine. Impeller is the default renderer on iOS. On Android, Impeller is available but not the default. This flag will cause Impeller to be used on Android. On other platforms, this flag will be ignored.
    --[no-]enable-flutter-gpu                                Whether to enable the Flutter GPU API (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_gpu/). This feature is only supported with the Impeller rendering engine, which can be enabled via the "--enable-impeller" option.
    --[no-]enable-vulkan-validation                          Enable vulkan validation on the Impeller rendering backend if Vulkan is in use and the validation layers are available to the application.
    --[no-]enable-embedder-api                               Whether to enable the experimental embedder API on iOS.
    --output-dill                                            Specify the path to frontend server output kernel file.
    --filesystem-root                                        Specify the path that is used as the root of a virtual file system during compilation. The input file name should be specified as a URL using the scheme given in "--filesystem-scheme".
                                                             Requires the "--output-dill" option to be explicitly specified.
    --filesystem-scheme                                      Specify the scheme that is used for virtual file system used in compilation. See also the "--filesystem-root" option.
                                                             (defaults to "org-dartlang-root")
    --extra-front-end-options=<--foo,--bar>                  A comma-separated list of additional command line arguments that will be passed directly to the Dart front end. For example, "--extra-front-end-options=--enable-experiment=nonfunction-type-aliases".
    --extra-gen-snapshot-options=<--foo,--bar>               A comma-separated list of additional command line arguments that will be passed directly to the Dart native compiler. (Only used in "--profile" or "--release" builds.) For example, "--extra-gen-snapshot-options=--no-strip".
    --frontend-server-starter-path                           When this value is provided, the frontend server will be started in JIT mode from the specified file, instead of from the AOT snapshot shipped with the Dart SDK. The specified file can either be a Dart source file, or an AppJIT snapshot. This option does not affect web builds.
    --enable-experiment                                      The name of an experimental Dart feature to enable. For more information see: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/docs/process/experimental-flags.md
    --initialize-from-dill                                   Initializes the resident compiler with a specific kernel file instead of the default cached location.
    --[no-]assume-initialize-from-dill-up-to-date            If set, assumes that the file passed in initialize-from-dill is up to date and skip the check and potential invalidation of files.
    --native-assets-yaml-file                                Initializes the resident compiler with a custom native assets yaml file instead of the default cached location.
    --[no-]publish-port                                      Publish the VM service port over mDNS. Disable to prevent the local network permission app dialog in debug and profile build modes (iOS devices only).
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --ignore-deprecation                                     Indicates that the app should ignore deprecation warnings and continue to build using deprecated APIs. Use of this flag may cause your app to fail to build when deprecated APIs are removed.
    --machine                                                Outputs in a machine readable structured JSON format.
    --[no-]await-first-frame-when-tracing                    Whether to wait for the first frame when tracing startup ("--trace-startup"), or just dump the trace as soon as the application is running. The first frame is detected by looking for a Timeline event with the name "Rasterized first useful frame". By default, the widgets library's binding takes care of sending this event.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --[no-]use-test-fonts                                    Enable (and default to) the "Ahem" font. This is a special font used in tests to remove any dependencies on the font metrics. It is enabled when you use "flutter test". Set this flag when running a test using "flutter run" for debugging purposes. This flag is only available when running in debug mode.
    --[no-]build                                             If necessary, build the app before running.
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --project-root                                           Specify the project root directory.
    --[no-]hot                                               Run with support for hot reloading. Only available for debug mode. Not available with "--trace-startup".
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --[no-]resident                                          Stay resident after launching the application. Not available with "--trace-startup".
                                                             (defaults to on)
    --pid-file                                               Specify a file to write the process ID to. You can send SIGUSR1 to trigger a hot reload and SIGUSR2 to trigger a hot restart. The file is created when the signal handlers are hooked and deleted when they are removed.
    --[no-]report-ready                                      Print "ready" to the console after handling a keyboard command.
                                                             This is primarily useful for tests and other automation, but consider using "--machine" instead.
    --benchmark                                              Enable a benchmarking mode. This will run the given application, measure the startup time and the app restart time, write the results out to "refresh_benchmark.json", and exit. This flag is intended for use in generating automated flutter benchmarks.

Run "flutter help" to see global options.
